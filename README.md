# GenLogger: The Logger That Speaks Your Language

Say hello to or **GenLogger** – the logger that makes your debugging a vibe. We’ve officially retired the tired old "DEBUG," "INFO," and "ERROR" for something with a little more personality: **YAP**, **DEETS**, **SKETCH**, **SUS**, and when things go totally sideways, **COOKED**. 

This isn’t just a logger; it’s a generational bridge for your codebase. Gen Z will call it lit, Millennials will embrace it ironically (but actually love it), and Boomers… well, they’ll ask for the docs (they wont be here long anyways). So why settle for boring logs when you can debug with *style*? Spice up your workflow and let your logs do the talking!

For now, we only support the coolest generation of all time – **Gen Z**. But don't worry, we'll be adding support for Millennials, Boomers, and other generations soon because we're all about inclusivity, even though y'all ain't as cool as us, you're still cool.


# Usage

To get started, simply integrate **GenLogger** into your existing code:

```python
import logging
from genlogger import GenLogging, GenZ
GenLogging(generation=GenZ)
```

This modifies the `logging` module in place and works seamlessly with your current setup. **Important:** Make sure you import `genlogger` *after* importing the `logging` module. If you import it before and your system gets **COOKED**, well… that’s on you. We’re Gen Z; we don’t write tests. 😉

# Contributing

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Dont expect everything in `README.md`. Also figure it out, documentation is not a **GenZ** thing.
